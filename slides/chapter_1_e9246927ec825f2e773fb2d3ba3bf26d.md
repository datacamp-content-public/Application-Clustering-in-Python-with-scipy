Hello everyone, I am your instructor, Shaumik. Now that you are familiar with various clustering techniques, let us discuss an important step in processing data before we apply any clustering algorithms

## Why do we need to prepare data for clustering?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b008ec98f2"
```

`@part1`
- Variables have incomparable units (product dimensions in cm, price in $)
{{1}}
- Variables with same units have vastly different scales and variances (expenditures on cereals, travel)
{{2}}
- Data in raw form may lead to bias in clustering
{{3}}
- Clusters may be heavily dependent on one variable
{{4}}
- Solution: Standardization of individual variables

`@script`
Why do we need to prepare data for clustering? Imagine a situation where you have a set of variables with incomparable units - such as the dimensions of a product and its price. Even if variables have the same unit, they may be significantly different in terms of their scales and variances. For instance, the amount that one may spend on an inexpensive item like cereals is low as compared to traveling expenses. If we use data in this raw form, the results of clustering may be biased. The clusters formed may be dependent on one variable significantly more than the other. How do we account for these issues, then? We use a process called standardization.

## Standardization of Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "312f450e14"

`@part1`
Standardization: Process of rescaling data to a mean of 0, standard deviation of 1
{{1}}

> x_new = (x - μ)/ σ
{{2}}

```
from sklearn import preprocessing
import numpy as np
data = [5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
data_array = np.array(data).reshape(-1, 1)
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data_array)
```

`@script`
What is standardization of data? It is a process by which we rescale the values of a variable with respect to the mean and standard deviation of the data. The resultant mean and standard deviation post standardization are 1 and 0, respectively. The process of standardization is simple and achieved through this formula - x minus mu, divided by sigma, where mu is the mean and sigma is the standard deviation. Let us look at its implementation in Python. A standardization library is available on scikit learn in Python, using the fit transform method of the standard scaler class. First, we initialize the standard scaler class and then use the fit_transform method, providing an array to transform. The array may be one or multi dimensional. Note that, in the example, we use a one dimensional array and hence reshape it in the form of a column before applying the standardization filter. The result of the fit transform method is an array of the same dimensions.

Let us look at a plot using the matplotlib library in Python to compare the results of the standardization process. The original and scaled lists have been plotted in blue and orange colors, respectively. As you can see, the scaled data mostly lies around zero, and the variation in it has been toned down from the original data. Interestingly, the trends remain similar to the original data though.

With this, we come to the end of the demonstration. It is time for you get familiar with the standardization process by writing some code of your own.
