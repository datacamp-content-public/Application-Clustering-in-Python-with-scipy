## Why do we need to prepare data for clustering?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b008ec98f2"
```

`@part1`
- Data in raw form may lead to bias in clustering
- Clusters may be heavily dependent on one variable

## Normalization of Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "312f450e14"
```

`@part1`
- Variables have incomparable units (product dimensions in cm, price in $)
- Variables with same units have vastly different variances (expenditures on cereals, fuel)
