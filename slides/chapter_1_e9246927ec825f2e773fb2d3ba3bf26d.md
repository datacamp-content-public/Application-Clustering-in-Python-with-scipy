## Why do we need to prepare data for clustering?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b008ec98f2"
```

`@part1`
- Variables have incomparable units (product dimensions in cm, price in $)
{{1}}
- Variables with same units have vastly different variances (expenditures on cereals, fuel)
{{2}}
- Data in raw form may lead to bias in clustering
{{3}}
- Clusters may be heavily dependent on one variable
{{4}}
- Solution: Standardization of individual variables
{{5}}

## Standardization of Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "312f450e14"
```

`@part1`
Standardization: Process of rescaling data to a mean of 0, standard deviation of 1
{{3}}

> x_new = (x - μ)/ σ
{{4}}

## Illustration: Standardization of Data

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "0c4191a5ec"
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn import preprocessing, numpy as np

scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
data_array = np.array(data).reshape(-1, 1)
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data_array)
```
