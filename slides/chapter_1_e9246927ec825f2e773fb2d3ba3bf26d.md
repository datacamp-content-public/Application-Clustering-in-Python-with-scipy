Hello, everyone. Now that you are familiar with various clustering techniques, let us discuss an important step in processing data before we apply any clustering algorithms

## Why do we need to prepare data for clustering?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b008ec98f2"
```

`@part1`
- Variables have incomparable units (product dimensions in cm, price in $)
{{1}}
- Variables with same units have vastly different variances (expenditures on cereals, travel)
{{2}}
- Data in raw form may lead to bias in clustering
{{3}}
- Clusters may be heavily dependent on one variable
{{4}}
- Solution: Standardization of individual variables
{{5}}


`@script`
Why do we need to prepare data for clustering? Imagine a situation where you have a set of variables with incomparable units - such as the dimensions of a product and its price in dollars. Even if variables have the same unit, they may have significantly different variances. For instance, the amount that one may spend on an inexpensive item like cereals is low as compared to traveling expenses. If we use data in this raw form, the results of clustering may be biased. The clusters formed may be dependent on one variable significantly more than the other. How do we account for these issues, then? We use a process called standardization.

## Standardization of Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "312f450e14"
```

`@part1`
Standardization: Process of rescaling data to a mean of 0, standard deviation of 1
{{1}}

> x_new = (x - μ)/ σ
{{2}}

```
from sklearn import preprocessing, numpy as np
data = [5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
data_array = np.array(data).reshape(-1, 1)
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data_array)
```

`@script`
What is standardization of data? It is a process by which we rescale the values of a variable with respect of the mean and standard deviation of the data. The resultant mean and standard deviation post standardization are 1 and 0, respectively. The process of standardization is simple and achieved through this formula - where mu is the mean and sigma is the standard deviation. A standardization library is available on scikit learn in Python, using the fit transform method of the standard scaler class. Note that, in the example, we use a one dimensional array and hence reshape it in the form of a column before applying the standardization filter.
